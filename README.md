# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-SmartCampusNetwork
A Cisco Packet Tracer simulation of a college campus network with 50+ nodes, wired and wireless devices, and a central library server hosting book info. It demonstrates real-world networking concepts including server setup, routers, switches, and Wi-Fi zones—ideal for learning campus-scale network design.
